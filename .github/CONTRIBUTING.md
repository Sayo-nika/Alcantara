# Alcantara Contribution Guidelines

Hey there, thank you for participating in Alcantara's development! Assuming you have everything set up,
then you shouldn't have problems settling in and contributing!

## Keep in mind

We don't use the Flutter SDK releases, we use the Upstream one with the Embedding API. Make sure you got
the [Alcantara Flutter SDK](https://github.com/Sayo-nika/Alcantara-FlutterSDK) and have them under `~/.local`.

## Spaces

Strictly 2 spaces. we don't do tabs.

## Braces

Braces style is C++/C#-like, which is newline-first, not statement after.

```dart

void uwu()
{
 // Newline Braces   
}
```
## Linting

Additional repository coding styles are enforced by the Linter. Make sure to run `dartfmt` regularly.

For Visual Studio Code users, if you have the Dart extension, IntelliSense already gives you the lint
output.

## QA

We are strict to Quality Assurance. We ave three fundamental values on Alcantara, which reflects the
fabric that is named after:

- All it does has to be clean and simple.
- It doesn't need to be heavy, nor it does need to use hacks to be performant.
- It doesn't work if it doesn't run fast! (Thank you GitHub, very cool)

## Conclusion?

Well yeah, that's it. What do you expect, Dio?

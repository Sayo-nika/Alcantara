# Alcantara

Alcantara is a experimental DDLC Launcher using Dart and Google's Flutter to achieve a refined and optimized application for managing DDLC Mods.

## Why Alcantara?

Alcantara has always been a symbol of luxury, you can find the Italian fabric in Microsoft Surface, luxury cars, for its durability, exquisite texture, and stain-free properties.

This project is named such because we try to encompass the values of Alcantara in a DDLC Launcher.

# Alcantara

Alcantara is a experimental DDLC Launcher using Dart and Google's Flutter to achieve a refined and optimized application for managing DDLC Mods.

## Why Alcantara?

Alcantara has always been a symbol of luxury, you can find the Italian fabric in Microsoft Surface, luxury cars, for its durability, exquisite texture, and stain-free properties.

This project is named such because we try to encompass the values of Alcantara in a DDLC Launcher.

## History

Alcantara is a indev project birthed from fDDME in hopes I can make the code understandable to myself (which in most cases, also readable for me).

Alcantara aims to do the following:

- Provide a sandbox instance for DDLC Mods by providing a stand-alone bundle of DDLC with the mod by grabbing the DDLC installation from Steam or your local HDD if not found.

- Reinvent how Mod Launcher design is supposed to be: Minimal with no gotchas and tricky SDKs to use with.

- To showcase that you can build launchers practically more with less code.

## Technical details

Alcantara will be using the [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.io) with Desktop Embedding support. Since Desktop embedding is experimental, it will be instrumental for us to use Flutter to provide feedback on the desktop embedding and Flutter itself.

We use [Dart](https://dartlang.org), which has been in consideration because of the size issues we're encountering with Node.js based applications that uses Electron. We hope Flutter+Dart can provide us performance that neither Electron or Node.js can offer.
